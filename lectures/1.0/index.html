          <h3 class="title">What is scientific programming?</h3>
          <div class="textbox"><p>
            In the strict sense, it is writing a logical sequence of instructions
            that can be interpreted by a computer to perform a desired task. 
            <br><br>
            More broadly, however, successful scientific programming involves a 
            larger set of tasks, including:
            (1) envisioning a useful end product; 
            (2) designing a user-friendly interface;
            (3) writing the source code;
            (4) annotating code for readability and comprehension;
            (5) making the tool installable across platforms;
            (6) writing documentation;
            (7) collaborating with a closed or open source community;
            (8) publishing.

          <div class="textbox"><p>
            A dialect we can use to provide instructions to the computer.
            Programming languages change over time, diverge from each other, or adopt from each other, 
            just like spoken languages. The popularity of different languages has varied through time 
            and among different communities of users.
            <br><br>
            In this class you will be introduced to several languages, including: <span style="color: orange">
            bash, HTML, Markdown, SVG, JavaScript, and Python; with greatest emphasis on bash and Python.</span>

            (1) To learn to design, code, and publish a software tool that can accomplish a useful task in biology; and

            to the biological data science community.

            <i>Primarily through our interactions and discussions.</i>
	          <br><br>
            When biological information is encoded as data, it becomes no different from any other type of data
            -- it is just text. The skills that we will focus on here will generally
            apply to any type of data. But, through our discussions in this class, 
            among a community of people developing software projects to solve 
		        biological problems, you will be exposed to numerous computational approaches for solving biological problems.
	          <br><br>
            However, we will spend some time to learn about particular biological
            data types and structures, including from genomic and geospatial data.

              <b>Short answer: yes</b>.<br>
              Scientific computing is overwhelmingly performed on operating systems
              based on the Unix architecture (e.g., Linux, MacOSX), 
              sometimes termed *nix systems. As research computing continues to 
              move into the cloud, these systems which are more scalable for multi-user and multi-tasking
              are likely to remain and even grow in popularity. Because of this, Windows has historically been 
              very difficult to use in research computing.<br><br>

              Fortunately, this has recently changed. As Microsoft has gained interest in cloud
              computing they have embraced Linux -- which for decades they had previously attacked 
              as a competitor -- and Linux can now be installed and run on Windows as a completely 
              contained additional operating system (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

          <h2><i>The shell or terminal (e.g., bash, zsh)</i></h2>
          <div class="textbox"><p>
					A terminal (also known as a shell) is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows
          users to interact with their computerâ€™s operating system by typing text commands.
          It serves as a gateway for executing programs, managing files, and controlling system
          processes without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI). The terminal interprets
          commands entered by the user and communicates with the operating system to carry out tasks.

          <h2>The Unix filesystem</h2>
          <div class="textbox"><p>
            It is <i>essential</i> to understand the hierarchical structure
            of the filesystem on your computer. Directories (folders) are 
            nested within directories, starting from the <i>root</i> (/).
            <br><br>
            Your first assignment will focus on learning the file hierarchy. Many of the errors
            you will encounter while learning to code will involve errors in writing filepaths. 
            Learning to traverse the filesystem efficiently, in a terminal, will superpower your
            efficiency in coding.
