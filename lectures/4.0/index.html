            Version control systems (particularly git) are useful for managing
            development of a codebase that is shared across multiple local repositories.
            Examples of when this could be useful are if you are working on a large
            project with multiple co-developers, each with your own copy of the code,
            and each responsible for updating specific parts of it.
            </br>
            It's simplest to think of the remote copy of the repository on GitHub as the
            'authoritative' copy (but this isn't true in a strict sense).

            If you and a partner are working on a repository that shares a 'remote'
            the git workflow ensures that there are not conflicts introduced in the
            codebase. If you change something and 'push', your partner needs to 'pull'
            and merge any changes (fixing any conflicts) before they can push their own changes.

            In practice, if you have a local repository and you are also modifying files
            on Github.com through the UI, then you are essentially 'collaborating with yourself',
            modifying two different copies of the code (local and remote), with the potential
            to introduce merge conflicts.

error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/iao2122/hack-2-shell.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do

                The simplest thing to do here is to just do what the `hint` says and 
                `git pull` before doing the push from local. You can also 'stash' local changes,
                but this is a topic for another time.

              <div class="textbox"><p style='text-align:center; color:white'>
                  In your assignment this week you will learn to install and use the
                  conda software package manager. This is a popular and powerful tool
                  for scientific programming. It allows you to automate the process of
                  finding and installing software, and dealing with dependencies.

              <div class="textbox"><p style='text-align:center; color:white'>
                  Later we will also learn how to write conda recipes so that you can make

              <div class="textbox"><p style='color:white'>
                Prior to conda there were many alternative ways to install software
                packages (and dependencies), which installed files and programs in different
                places. This would usually result in a "hairball" of conflicts among installed
                software, leading to things breaking and being a huge mess to clean up.

              <div class="textbox"><p style='color:white'>
                Conda solves this problem by allowing you to create and manage 'environments'
                for installing software and dependencies. Environments are isolated from one
                another, so if something breaks in one environment it doesn't break your
                whole system, and it can be easily cleaned up by simply removing the broken
                environment.

              Python introduction (objects)</h3>
              <div class="textbox"><p style='text-align:center; color:white'>
                  Everything in Python is an *object*. This is inherent in the design
                  of the language, and something that we will learn to explore
                  further as we become more advanced. An integer is an object, a function
                  is an object, and a Class is an object.

                  <br><br>
                  At its base, Python includes a small number of basic *object types*.
                  Once these basic types were defined, it turns out that you can create
                  almost anything by using them in creative ways. In this way, most
                  of the Python programming language is actually written in Python.
                  These basic types include integers, floats, strings, dictionaries, lists, etc.
                  You will learn about these types this week.

              Python introduction (string types)</h3>
              <div class="textbox"><p style='text-align:center; color:white'>
                  String type objects are used to represent one or more characters.
                  Strings are created by using either single or double quotes.
                  You can perform operations on strings, such as combining them or
                  reformatting them to accomplish very complex tasks.
                  <br><br>
                  To start, we need to create a string type object. We do this by
                  storing the value of a string to a variable name. String objects
                  have more than just their value attached to them. In addition, we
                  can access other attributes and functions from
                  the string object by using a dot after the object.

              Object oriented programming</h3>
              <div class="textbox"><p style='text-align:center; color:white'>
                  Object oriented programming is a style of programming design
                  where that functions that are meant to be called on a given type
                  of object are *attached* to that object. This makes it easy to find
                  all of the available options given some object, and ensures you call
                  the right type of function on the right type of object.
                  <br>
                  Coding development tools like jupyter or a good coding editor like vscode
                  makes it easier to write Python code by taking advantage of this design.
                  When writing Python code you can use tab-completion to see all options
                  from your current object.
